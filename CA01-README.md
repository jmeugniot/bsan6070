**Dropped Columns from Analysis**
1. stn_code
2. agency

4. location_monitoring_agency

**Downloading & Using the Data**

Data file saved as 'india_data.csv'
If the code yeilds an error when reading it try downloading the file, open in excel, and resave as a CSV file.
To avoid an upload error I saved the data file in excel as a CSV UTF 8(comma delimited) file.
